    Destiny 2: Beyond Light is a major expansion for Destiny 2, a first-person shooter video game developed by Bungie.<br> 
    It was released on November 10, 2020, as the fifth expansion of Destiny 2. <br>
    Players travel to Jupiter's icy moon Europa to confront the Fallen Kell Eramis, who plans to use the power of the Darkness to save her people and take revenge on the Traveler back on Earth, as she and many Fallen believe that the Traveler had abandoned them before the Golden Age of humanity. <br>
    The player's Guardian also obtains this new Darkness-based power as a subclass called Stasis, which features new ice-based abilities that can freeze enemies. <br>
    The expansion sees the return of the Exo Stranger from the original Destiny's campaign, as well as Variks from the original game's House of Wolves expansion, both of which guides the Guardian on Europa.<br>
    Furthermore, Beyond Light adds other content across the game, including missions, player versus environment locations, player gear, weaponry, and a raid. <br>
</main>    
    Beyond Light is the first expansion of Destiny 2 to be released on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S platforms. 
    Bungie described this expansion as the beginning of a new era for the Destiny franchise.
