            <p>Destiny 2 is a free-to-play online-only multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed by Bungie. </p>
            <p>It was originally released as a pay to play game in 2017 for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows platforms.</p>
            <p>Set in a "mythic science fiction" world, the game features a multiplayer "shared-world" environment with elements of role-playing games.</p>
            <p>Activities in Destiny 2 are divided among player versus environment (PvE) and player versus player (PvP) game types.</p> 
            
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>In addition to normal story missions, PvE features three-player "strikes" and dungeons and six-player raids.</p> 
            <p>A free roam patrol mode is also available for each destination which feature public events as well as activities not available in the original.</p> 
            <p>These activities have an emphasis on exploration of the destinations and interactions with non-player characters (NPCs); the original Destiny only featured NPCs in social spaces.</p> 
            <p>PvP features objective-based modes, as well as traditional deathmatch game modes.</p>
