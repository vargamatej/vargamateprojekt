    Destiny 2 is a free-to-play online-only multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed by Bungie. <br>
        It was originally released as a pay to play game in 2017 for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows platforms.<br>
        Set in a "mythic science fiction" world, the game features a multiplayer "shared-world" environment with elements of role-playing games.<br> 
        Activities in Destiny 2 are divided among player versus environment (PvE) and player versus player (PvP) game types.<br> 
        In addition to normal story missions, PvE features three-player "strikes" and dungeons and six-player raids.<br> 
        A free roam patrol mode is also available for each destination which feature public events as well as activities not available in the original.<br> 
        These activities have an emphasis on exploration of the destinations and interactions with non-player characters (NPCs); the original Destiny only featured NPCs in social spaces.<br> 
        PvP features objective-based modes, as well as traditional deathmatch game modes.<br>
